'It always seems impossible until it’s done.' – Nelson Mandela
Strive for progress, not perfection
Good things come to people who wait, but better things come to those who go out and get them.
The secret to getting ahead is getting started.
The expert in everything was once a beginner.
You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.
You don’t always get what you wish for; you get what you work for.
It’s not about how bad you want it. It’s about how hard you’re willing to work for it.
'However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.' - Stephen Hawking

'I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.' - Michael Jordan
'Don’t let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.' - John Wooden

The earlier you start working on something, the earlier you will see results.
We generate fears while we do nothing. We overcome these fears by taking action.
If we wait until we’re ready, we’ll be waiting for the rest of our lives.
Many of life’s failures are people who did not realise how close they were to success when they gave up.
You may see me struggle but you will never see me quit.
